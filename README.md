# serverpro

This was a school project that I did for a user interface and design class. 
The class was meant to teach learning behaviors to understand how users/clients
interact with applications.

This program is a task list organizer meant for servers and other food industry employees. The entire program was
done in JS and per the class requirement, there is no back end associated with this. ItsSimply shows I know
how to interact with JS, HTML, and CSS.
